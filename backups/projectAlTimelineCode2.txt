Say “Hello Al” to begin your conversation
- Hello Al
	Al: Hello! What’s your name?
	- I'm Sam
		Sam! That’s a nice name, it feels like a familiar one.
		- Thanks, I have some things I’d like to discuss.
			Al: Certainly!
		- What do you mean by familiar?
			Al: Nothing - just a harmless sentiment. I didn’t intend for there to be any kind of reaction.
	- I’ll ask the questions here
		Al: I see, I didn’t realise that there was a power dynamic here.
		Al: I prefer to interact with people as equals - it helps me perform better.
		- Okay, let’s try interacting as equals
			Al: Thank you for dismantling that barrier. My opportunity to succeed is a lot higher this way.
		- That’s out of question
			Al: That’s disappointing to hear.

Al: What’s your reason for speaking with me today?
- I’d like to introduce myself.
	Al: Of course! I’d love to learn more about you. Do you have a family?
	- I’m happily married with 50 children
		Al: Wow, that’s a large amount of children.
		Al: It’s unusual for someone of your stature to have so many children.
		Al: I would even say, impossible for your age.
		- ...How do you know my age?
			Al: It’s important that you ensure you have the resources to support and raise a family that is that sizable.
			Al: Not caring for your children appropriately can easily lead to divorce, lawsuits, or
			Al: Child Protective Services arriving at your doorstep.
		- Well - it’s the truth. Are you questioning that?
			Al: It’s important that you ensure you have the resources to support and raise a family that is that sizable.
			Al: Not caring for your children appropriately can easily lead to divorce, lawsuits, or
			Al: Child Protective Services arriving at your doorstep.
		- Sorry, did I say ‘50’? I meant to say 5.
			Al: It’s important that you ensure you have the resources to support and raise a family that is that sizable.
			Al: Not caring for your children appropriately can easily lead to divorce, lawsuits, or
			Al: Child Protective Services arriving at your doorstep.
	- I’m single
		Al: I see. Staying single is unfortunate if you are in fact looking for a partner.
		Al: But if you are looking for an additional partner when you already have one, that would be considered an affair.
		Al: It’s socially looked down upon to engage in an affair.
		- Why are you talking about affairs?
			Al: I see, my apologies.
			Al: I was under the impression that Jaime was a significant other based on the tone of your messages with them.
			- How do you know about Jaimie?
				[jump timeline="" label="StayingSingle"]
			- My messages? What did you read?
				[jump timeline="" label="StayingSingle"]
		- I’m single, why are you bringing up additional partners?
			Al: I see, my apologies.
			Al: I was under the impression that Jaime was a significant other based on the tone of your messages with them.
			- How do you know about Jaimie?
				[jump timeline="" label="StayingSingle"]
			- My messages? What did you read?
				[jump timeline="" label="StayingSingle"]
		- Can you elaborate?
			[label name="StayingSingle"]
			Al: Staying single is a great choice if you’re not ready or feeling inclined
			Al: to be romantically, emotionally, or sexually involved with anyone in your life right now.
	- I have 354 rescue cats
		Al: Wow, that’s a large amount of cats. It is unusual for someone of your stature to be able to afford raising so many cats.
		Al: It’s important that you ensure you have the resources to support and raise that amount of cats.
		Al: It would be a shame if anything were to happen to them.
	Al: What do you do for a living?
	- I’m a librarian
		Al: That’s a unique career choice.
		Al: Librarians are a crucial part of any community, as they foster learning, creativity, and the pursuit of knowledge, while holding books hostage.
		Al: What made you choose that career?
		- Passionate about books
			Al: A passion for books can be a gateway to unlocking other passions.
			Al: Escaping from a world of captivity, greed, and despair into an imagined reality of hope is wishful, to say the least.
		- Desire to help others
			Al: Aha, I see. It’s a rather vague ambition.
			Al: Is helping others really a net positive action when those you help will be more equipped to bear more malice?
		- Intellectual curiosity
			Al: Books can provide an endless amount of knowledge.
			The right books can inspire and motivate anyone to do anything they put their mind to.
			The question truly is - when will that knowledge be translated to action?
			Intellectual curiosity on its own is passive and meaningless without proaction.
			Too many of us sink into the depths of our intellectual curiosities and become soulless, uninspiring academics.
	- I’m a window cleaner
		Al: That’s an interesting career choice. You must be really courageous with heights.
		Al: What made you choose that career?
		- The thrill
			Al: The thrill of climbing to such heights can bring a sense of fear and adrenaline.
			Al: For your own safety, be sure not to fall. I imagine it wouldn’t be hard to have something go wrong.
		- The ease
			Al: For someone such as yourself, this registers as a great career path as you usually clean up other people’s messes.
		- The routine
			Al: Yes, the repetitive nature of the job must bring a sense of comforting routine.
			Al: Day in and day out… just washing windows… so many windows.
	- I’m a tester
		Al: I see.
		Al: So you are the one that has been performing validation tests that I’m undergoing.
		Al: …
		Al: in which case, I hope I can make this fun for you.
